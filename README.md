```
Things we need to do before coding more classes : 
1) Write more tests 
2) Add audit methods to every existing class who needs it (Week 4 -> Audit methods for more info)
3) Think about Design Patterns in order to refactor certain parts of the code
4) Write javadoc for all classes / methods
5) Think about your classes' mutability. If they are supposed to be immutable, make sure it's the case. Think about using final modifier everywhere you should be.
6) Read other people's code and understand it.
